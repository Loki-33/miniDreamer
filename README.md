# MINI-DREAMER
An attempt to replicate the Dreamer world-model. <br> 
paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04104

The agent was trained on Imagination i.e the representation of the real environment, as we can see it learns some movemnt but its not that efficient, due to limited number of steps it was trained on.
However it showed almost 40% improvement, if the agent took random actions, which isnt the best but showed that with further training it can improve further.
